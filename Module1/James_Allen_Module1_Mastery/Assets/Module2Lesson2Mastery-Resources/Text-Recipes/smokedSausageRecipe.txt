Smoked Sausage - Recipe

Everything is better in the smoker and these smoked sausages are no exception! They'll spend about 2-3 hours in the smoker and come out perfectly juicy and tender with a bit of a bite to the skin on the outside. If you've only had brats on the grill, I highly recommend trying them on the smoker next weekend!

Ingredients:

16 oz. your favorite sausages (I used jalapeno cheddar bratwurst)

Steps:

1. Heat wood pellet/chip smoker to 225 degrees.

2. Place sausages on the grill rack about an inch or so apart.

3. Smoke for 2-3 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.

4. Serve with your favorites like sour kraut and Dijon mustard on a whole wheat bun.
