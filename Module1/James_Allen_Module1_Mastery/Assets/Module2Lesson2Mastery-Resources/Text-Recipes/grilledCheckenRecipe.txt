Grilled Chicken - Recipe

There’s nothing better than grilled BBQ chicken breast on a warm summer evening. It’s flavorful, light, and versatile — and with a few simple tips it stays juicy and moist (not dry or tough). Plus, this easy meal is incredibly fast! You only need about 10 minutes of prep and 10 minutes to cook the meat, so the entire dinner is ready in 20 minutes.

Ingredients:

This is a quick overview of the ingredients that you’ll need for grilled bbq chicken breast. As always, specific measurements and complete cooking instructions are included in the printable recipe box at the bottom of the post.

1. Boneless skinless chicken breasts: you can also substitute with boneless, skinless chicken thighs.

2. Olive oil: helps the chicken brown, adds flavor, and prevents it from sticking to the grill.

3. BBQ dry rub: we always use this simple homemade BBQ seasoning blend, which we keep in a big jar in our pantry for easy access. It includes brown sugar, smoked paprika, kosher salt, chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder. If you prefer, you can substitute with your favorite store-bought BBQ rub or just use kosher salt and black pepper (the chicken will get a lot of flavor from the BBQ sauce).

4. Barbecue sauce: use your favorite homemade bbq sauce or pick a high-quality store-bought sauce. We like Stubb’s sauce (which has a vinegary tang) or Sweet Baby Ray’s (a sweeter, thicker option).

Steps:

1. Pound chicken breasts until ½-inch thick. You don’t want them as thin as cutlets, but pounding them to an even thickness will help the chicken cook quickly and evenly so that it stays tender and juicy.

2. Rub chicken with olive oil and season with bbq rub.

3. Grill the chicken until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.

4. Baste the chicken with the bbq sauce towards the end.

5. Let the chicken rest before slicing and serving.
