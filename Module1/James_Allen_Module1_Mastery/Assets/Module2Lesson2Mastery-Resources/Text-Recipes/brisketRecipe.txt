Texas Smoked Brisket - Recipe

This traditional Texas-style brisket recipe will teach you how to produce a great piece of smoked meat and help you take your brisket to a whole new level.

Brisket is a delicious treat when cooked right. It is tender, juicy, and just plain tasty! Make sure to rinse your brisket in lukewarm water and pat it dry with paper towels before putting on the brisket rub. This recipe calls for an 8- to 10-pound brisket to serve 6 people, and while this may seem like a lot of meat, keep in mind that brisket loses around 30 to 40 percent of its weight during smoking due to the amount of collagen in the meat. 

Make sure to take the time to wrap it in aluminum foil once your smoking brisket reaches 170 F to ensure that your meat achieves the full amount of tenderness.

Once you've tasted this smoked brisket recipe, you'll see what all the fuss of a properly cooked piece of brisket is about. Slice and serve your brisket with potato salad, coleslaw, baked beans, homemade bread or dinner rolls.
